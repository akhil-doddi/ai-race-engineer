## [0.3.4] — 2026-04-07 — Phase 3 #5: VSC/SC Behavior Differentiation

### Added
- `src/telemetry/udp_sender.py`: Separate deployment windows for VSC and full SC.
  VSC deploys randomly in laps 3–9 (tyres fresh, no pit warranted).
  Full SC deploys randomly in laps 33–43 (tyres old, free pit is correct strategy).
  Each type picks its own random lap within its window on every run so no two sessions are identical.
- `src/events/event_detector.py`: VSC conditional pit logic.
  Full SC always sets `should_pit = True` (field compressed, pit cost neutralised).
  VSC sets `should_pit = True` only if `tire_age >= expected_stint - 2` OR `tire_life < 35%`.
  Below both thresholds VSC sets `should_pit = False` — stay out, hold delta.
- `src/strategy/strategy_tracker.py`: `VSC_OPPORTUNITY` trigger — fires once per VSC period
  regardless of `should_pit`. Always delivers a radio advisory. `build_prompt` branches on
  `should_pit` to produce either a "box this lap" or "maintain delta, stay out" brief.
- `src/strategy/strategy_tracker.py`: `_vsc_called` flag — prevents `VSC_OPPORTUNITY` from
  repeating during a single VSC period. Resets to False when track returns to green (same
  lifecycle as `_sc_pit_called`).
- `src/main.py`: `"VSC_OPPORTUNITY": "🟡 VIRTUAL SAFETY CAR — ADVISORY"` label in `speak_proactive()`.
- `src/main.py`: `is_vsc` guard in the urgency-change handler — blocks auto-pit via the
  urgency path when `track_status == "virtual_safety_car"`, even if `should_pit = True`.
  VSC decisions are advisory; auto-pit only fires for full SC and tyre-critical alerts.

### Changed
- `src/strategy/strategy_tracker.py`: SC block in `evaluate()` now branches on `track_status_now`:
  VSC → fires `VSC_OPPORTUNITY` then returns `[]`.
  Full SC → fires `SC_OPPORTUNITY` if conditions met then returns `[]`.
  Structural principle: shared detection infrastructure, branched decision.
- `src/strategy/strategy_tracker.py`: `SC_OPPORTUNITY` prompt simplified — VSC-specific
  wording removed now that `VSC_OPPORTUNITY` handles it separately.
- `src/main.py`: `speak_proactive()` pit trigger guard remains `("PIT_NOW", "SC_OPPORTUNITY")` —
  `VSC_OPPORTUNITY` is intentionally excluded. VSC advisory never auto-pits the car.

## [0.3.3] — 2026-04-07 — Phase 3 #4: Per-Event Gap Alert Cooldown

### Added
- `src/events/event_detector.py`: Cooldown constants `COOLDOWN_GAP_ALERT = 3` and
  `COOLDOWN_PIT_WINDOW = 3`. Module-level `_cooldowns` dict with helpers
  `_on_cooldown(key, lap, n)` and `_start_cooldown(key, lap)`.
- `src/events/event_detector.py`: `reset_cooldowns()` — clears all cooldown state.
  Called at race start in `main.py` so prior session state does not carry over.
- `src/main.py`: Gap alert cooldown applied at the SPEAK decision point in the urgency-change
  handler. Detects gap alerts by checking the reason string for `"attack window"` or
  `"car behind closing"`. Suppresses the speak call if the same alert fired within the
  last 3 laps, but leaves `last_urgency` tracking the true urgency throughout.

### Fixed
- **Critical bug:** Initial cooldown implementation placed inside `get_event()`, returning
  `urgency = "green"` during cooldown periods. This reset `last_urgency` to green on every
  suppressed poll, creating a new green→yellow transition when the cooldown expired — making
  gap alerts fire MORE frequently, not less. Fix: moved cooldown to the SPEAK decision in
  `proactive_monitor`; `last_urgency` is now updated before the speak block so it tracks
  true urgency throughout cooldown windows.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-04-07 — FINISH_RACE: Suppress Planned Pit Windows in Endgame

### Added
- `strategy_tracker.py`: `FINISH_RACE` trigger — fires when a pre-planned pit stop window
  arrives during endgame phase (`race_phase == "endgame"`). Delivers a "pit stop not required,
  maintain position, bring it home" message instead of a pit warning.
- `strategy_tracker.py`: `_finish_race_called` flag — prevents `FINISH_RACE` from repeating
  per stint. Resets in `reset_pit()` so a new stint that also ends in endgame is handled.
- `strategy_tracker.py`: Endgame guards on `PIT_APPROACHING`, `PIT_NOW`, and `PLAN_CHANGED` —
  all three now include `event.get("race_phase", "mid") != "endgame"` conditions.
  `FINISH_RACE` takes over the communication slot; the pit triggers must be silent.
- `main.py`: `"FINISH_RACE": "🏁 FINISH — NO MORE STOPS"` label entry in `speak_proactive()`.

### Fixed
- **Bug:** `PIT_APPROACHING` fired with 9 laps remaining, producing "Pit stop in 3 laps; we'll
  box on Lap 52" despite the race being almost over. Root cause: `PIT_APPROACHING` evaluated
  purely on lap arithmetic (`current_lap == planned_pit_lap - 3`) with no race phase awareness.
  Because tyre wear was reported as fuel-critical (not a `should_pit` path), `endgame_override`
  was never set, so `ENDGAME_MANAGE` never fired as a replacement. The fix adds explicit
  endgame guards to `PIT_APPROACHING`, `PIT_NOW`, and `PLAN_CHANGED`, and introduces
  `FINISH_RACE` as the dedicated trigger for this scenario.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-04-07 — Endgame Race Strategy Logic

### Added
- `event_detector.py`: `_get_race_phase()` — classifies race into `"early"`, `"mid"`, or `"endgame"`
  based on laps remaining. Endgame activates at `ENDGAME_LAP_THRESHOLD = 10` laps remaining.
- `event_detector.py`: Endgame override block — when in endgame phase and tyre life is above
  `ENDGAME_CRITICAL_TYRE = 15%`, all pit recommendations are suppressed and replaced with tyre
  management guidance. SC pits are excluded (free stop remains valid). Tyre below 15% is excluded
  (safety concern outweighs track position).
- `event_detector.py`: Two new keys in the returned event dict: `race_phase` and `endgame_override`.
  `endgame_override = True` signals downstream layers that a pit was suppressed by race phase.
- `strategy_tracker.py`: `ENDGAME_MANAGE` trigger — fires once per stint when `endgame_override = True`
  and tyre life is below 40%. Produces survival-mode radio brief instead of pit call.
- `strategy_tracker.py`: `_endgame_manage_called` flag prevents ENDGAME_MANAGE from repeating.
  Resets in `reset_pit()` so a second stint ending in endgame is handled correctly.
- `strategy_tracker.py`: `laps_rem` variable in `build_prompt()` for use in ENDGAME_MANAGE prompt.
- `main.py`: `ENDGAME_MANAGE` entry in label dict (`🏁 ENDGAME — TYRE MANAGEMENT`).

### Changed
- `event_detector.py`: `get_event()` now returns `race_phase` and `endgame_override` keys.
- `main.py`: Auto-pit threshold guard changed from `laps_remaining > 3` to
  `laps_remaining > ENDGAME_LAP_THRESHOLD`. Prevents 50%-tyre auto-pit in the final 10 laps.
- `main.py`: Urgency-change box handler now checks `not event.get("endgame_override", False)`
  before calling `trigger_pit()`. Endgame tyre alerts speak without boxing the car.
- `main.py`: Imports `ENDGAME_LAP_THRESHOLD` from `event_detector` (single source of truth).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-06 — Phase 2 Complete: Live UDP Telemetry

### Added
- `src/telemetry/udp_listener.py` — live Codemasters F1 24 UDP packet parser on port 20777.
  Parses PacketLapData, PacketCarStatusData, PacketCarTelemetryData, PacketSessionData.
  Decodes tyre compound, wear, fuel, gaps, position, and track status (safety car via weather byte).
- `src/telemetry/udp_sender.py` — standalone race simulation sender for testing without a PS5.
  Full 53-lap race simulation with cliff tyre model, safety car periods, realistic fuel burn.
- `src/telemetry/pit_state_machine.py` — finite state machine for interactive pit stop simulation.
  States: RACING → PIT_ENTRY (2s) → PIT_STOP (5s) → PIT_EXIT (2s) → RACING.
  Applies compound rotation (Soft→Medium, Medium→Hard, Hard→Medium) and fresh tyre overrides.
- `src/telemetry/telemetry_controller.py` — transparent wrapper over any telemetry source.
  Applies pit stop overrides during active pit phases; maintains post-pit persistent tyre
  overrides so the AI sees fresh rubber data after every stop, not stale UDP data.
- `src/strategy/strategy_tracker.py` — proactive pit trigger engine.
  Triggers: INITIAL_BRIEF, PLAN_CHANGED, PIT_APPROACHING, PIT_NOW, SC_OPPORTUNITY.
  Safety car logic: one prompt per SC period, all normal pit triggers blocked during SC.
  Guards: `_pit_called`, `_approaching_called`, `_sc_pit_called` flags prevent duplicate calls.

### Changed
- `src/main.py` — full rewrite as dual-thread orchestrator.
  Thread A: proactive monitor polling at 1.0s intervals.
  Thread B: reactive driver input loop (main thread).
  `TelemetryController` wraps raw source — one-line swap between simulator and UDP.
  Auto-pit triggers at 50% tyre life; resets correctly between stints via shared `_auto_pit_state` dict.
  Urgency-change and strategy tracker evaluation both guarded by `is_pitting` check — no duplicate
  BOX calls while car is in the pit lane.
- `src/voice/tts_engine.py` — replaced pyttsx3 with macOS `say` subprocess.
  pyttsx3 raises `RuntimeError: run loop already started` when called from a non-main thread on macOS.
  `say` is a separate process, fully thread-safe, and supports the same macOS voice names.
- `src/events/event_detector.py` — safety car pit detection, SC_MIN_TYRE_AGE constant (5 laps).
  Removed all undercut-based pit recommendations.
- `docs/roadmap.md` — Phase 2 marked complete, Phase 3 marked as next.
- `docs/decisions.md` — added ADR-008 through ADR-012 for Phase 2 architectural decisions.

### Removed
- `UNDERCUT_URGENT` trigger — car-behind-based BOX calls removed per driver preference.
- `UNDERCUT_OPPORTUNITY` trigger — gap-ahead-based offensive BOX calls removed.
